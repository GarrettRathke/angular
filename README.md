A Practice Application for Learning Angular2

All Angular2 apps have <strong>Modules</strong> and <strong>Components</strong>, which, together, make up the basic structure of the app.

The <strong>Module</strong> is the largest piece of an Angular2 app. <strong>Components</strong> live inside of <strong>Modules</strong>. Modules are just a single TypeScript file (<em>.ts</em>). Components are a combination of a TypeScript file, an HTML file, a CSS file, and perhaps a test file. Angular2 lingo can be a bit sloppy when referring to Components because sometimes the aforementioned group of files together is called a Component and other times just the TypeScript file is the called the Component. In the latter case, the HTML file is referred to as the <strong>Template</strong>.
